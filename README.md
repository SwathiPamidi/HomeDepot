Using GitHub API and list of repos is shown for a given organization or user in List/Grid format. 

UICollectionView is used to display list/grid, using segment control added ability to toggle between list/grid.
 
API endpoint - " https://api.github.com/users/apple/repos?page=1&per_page=10 "  where apple, page, per_page are input variables. Use a text field to accept user â€“ apple, Facebook or any. When I scroll to the bottom of page, you should request for next set of repos i.e., if applicable page=2&per_page=10 and append to existing result.
 
UICollectionViewCell display's these labels:
 
"name": "example-package-dealer",
"description": "Example package for use with the Swift Package Manager"
"created_at": "2015-11-10T19:52:44Z"
